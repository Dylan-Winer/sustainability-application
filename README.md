# sustainability-application
**Summary**
For my personal project, I created an iPad application that educates 4th-grade students on topics including global warming, renewable energy, plastic pollution, and sustainable farming in accordance with their environmental sustainability unit. This application combines article-like pages that simplify these concepts along with interactive elements, such as categorizing activities and self-reflection. I chose this topic because I have always been passionate about environmental stewardship and promoting awareness regarding the importance of integrating sustainability into society. This project directly connects to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11, 12, and 13, which are all related to global sustainability. My application promotes Goal #11, sustainable cities, through activities centered around renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. Likewise, Goal #12, responsible consumption, and Goal #13, the climate crisis, are tackled in my application across plastic pollution and global warming exercises.
